# Homes Demo iOS

A quick demo project showing a home comparison feature built with SwiftUI. The app allows users to favorite homes and compare their selected properties in a detailed comparison view.
* (Note: I spent just 2-3 hours working on this so there might be bugs)

## Features
* Browse homes with images and details
* Favorite homes functionality with persistence
* Compare multiple homes in a detailed grid view
* Interactive map view for home locations

## Technologies
* SwiftUI for UI development
* Combine framework for networking and data handling
* UserDefaults for favorites persistence
* MapKit integration for location display

## Potential Improvements
As this is a demo project focused on showcasing the comparison feature, there are several areas where it could be enhanced:

* Implement a file manager for image caching to prevent repeated downloads
* Utilize dependency injection and protocols for better code decoupling
* Add proper error handling and loading states

## Note
This project just serves as a quick demonstration of functionality, particularly the comparison feature in the favorites tab. It's not intended as a production ready application but rather as a showcase of SwiftUI capabilities and basic architectural patterns.
